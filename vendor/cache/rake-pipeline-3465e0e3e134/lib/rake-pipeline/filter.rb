    # A Filter is added to a pipeline and converts input files
    # into output files.
    #
    # Filters operate on FileWrappers, which abstract away the
    # root directory of a file, providing a relative path and
    # a mechanism for reading and writing.
    #
    #
    # For instance, a filter to wrap the contents of each file
    # in a JavaScript closure would look like:
    #
    #   !!!ruby
    #   require "json"
    #
    #   class ClosureFilter < Rake::Pipeline::Filter
    #     def generate_output(inputs, output)
    #       inputs.each do |input|
    #         output.write "(function() { #{input.read.to_json} })()"
    #       end
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # A filter's files come from the input directory or the directory
    # owned by the previous filter, but filters are insulated from
    # this concern.
    #
    # You can call +path+ on a FileWrapper to get the file's relative
    # path, or `fullpath` to get its absolute path, but you should,
    # in general, not use `fullpath` but instead use methods of
    # FileWrapper like `read` and `write` that abstract the details
    # from you.
    #
    # @see ConcatFilter Rake::Pipeline::ConcatFilter for another
    #   example filter implementation.
